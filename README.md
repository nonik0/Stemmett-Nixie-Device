A Nixie device that uses PL31 socket compatible Nixie tube (IN-4, IN-7) in different orientations to spell stuff. The board itself just has 6 sockets and then the board with the Nixie sockets themselves are in different rotatation, which allows for a large range of potential things to spell with cheaper Nixie tubes!
